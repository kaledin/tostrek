Half the consoles flicker erratically, their displays glitching between tactical readouts and static, while sparks occasionally spit from overloaded circuits. The command chair sits askew on its mounting, its leather scorched by plasma fires. A jagged crack runs across the main viewscreen, distorting the starfield beyond into fractured lines. The air reeks of burnt insulation and ionized metal, and the deck vibrates unevenly beneathfoot - somewhere, a damaged war coil thrums out of sync.\n\tEmergency lighting bathes everything in a dim red haze, broken only by the erratic flashes of dying monitors. The cloak control panel has been pried open, its innards exposed in a tangle of ripped-out isolinear chips and hastily spliced wires. A dark stain near the tactical station goes ignored - whoever bled there didn't survive long enough for cleanup.",
