TOS Trek++ is a simple singleplayer text RPG in development. I took some inspiration from TOS TrekMUSE, a long-time defunct MUSH that I used to play in the early late 1990s and early 2000s.

My plan is to add some basic orientation commands like every MUD/MUSH has, then expand it by adding a space system, AI-driven (God forbid) NPCs.

This is singleplayer intentionally, I will be the only person playing it, I admit it. 

Requirements:
* tested on macos and Linux (but should run in Windows also if you have a dev environment setup there)
* a C++ compiler capable of -std=c++23

Installation:
* just run `make`

3rd party software included:
* nlohmann/json serialization/deserialization, which is distributed under MIT license.
